# Diagnosis-detection

Automatic recognition of a disease based on its historical data (Training data in our case). 

A disease is characterized by its diagnosis parameters. This algorithm considers those parameters as random variable's.

This program accepts two parameters as data and considers it as a **random vector**( you can further develop this to n-parameters).

From this point forward we call input data as **Training data**. Training data fall into two categories: 1) those that exhibit the disease 2) those free of the disease 

We now give an input and the program does a random vector analysis and predicts if the given input is diagnosed with the disease or not.
